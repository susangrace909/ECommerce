# E-commerce Back End Starter Code

- As a manager at an internet retail company, I want a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies so that my company can compete with other e-commerce companies.

## Acceptance Criteria

- When I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file, then I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize.
- When I enter schema and seed commands,
  then a development database is created and is seeded with test data.
- When I enter the command to invoke the application, then my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database.
- When I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags, then the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON.
- When I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia, then I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database.
